# PrescriptionValidator
The project's primary objective is to minimize drug prescription errors, particularly those stemming from communication barriers and human mistakes. Additionally, it strives to ensure accessibility for individuals from diverse linguistic backgrounds, bridging the gap between patients and physicians. This comprehensive solution serves as an invaluable resource for doctors, patients, and community workers.

The backend component plays a pivotal role, offering an API endpoint that analyzes prescription and appointment transcript text. It provides a response indicating the presence or absence of potential error flags, thus contributing to safer and more effective healthcare practices.
